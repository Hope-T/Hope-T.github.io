## Summer 2020: Computer Science Research Intern under Dr. Anyi Liu (Oakland Community College)

As Dr. Liu used Python, and Amherst College mainly teaches Java, I taught myself Python in the spring.

- During the summer, I researched, learned, and used Protégé and VOWL to explore patterns in documented hacking methods by focusing on association rule mining and natural language processing. 
- I used NLTK to extract words from text files and tag their parts of speech.
- I performed association rule mining to discover the relationships between words by calculating the lift and confidence between the target words and other words in the text file.

The code is available upon request.
