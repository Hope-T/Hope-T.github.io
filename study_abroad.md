# Study Abroad Semester

I spent the spring semester in Budapest, Hungary, at AIT Budapest. I absolutely loved my time there, and experienced many firsts, such as living on my own, 
traveling internationally, and booking hostels. I will take the problem solving and research skills I learned into the rest of my life.

Re: academic life, I took Graph Theory, Hungarian Culture and Cinema, Semantic and Declarative Technologies (Prolog, logic), and Deep Learning. 
To see homework and exams, please contact me at tsaihope45@gmail.com.


For my cinema class, I created a short film that aimed to capture the feeling of nostalgia and sense of adventure that I would feel after my travels. I feel 
very proud of it, even though I know that it's not that special and I'm not a film major! Here is the link: [Hello, Croatia!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YMe7DSVoLcAEkys6FKwQ3pZRvJwbUNQv/preview)
