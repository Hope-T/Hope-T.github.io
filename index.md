## About
 Though I had planned on studying English, I realized that I love, and need, the groundedness of these two subjects.
  Just as in English, my initial major, I see the beauty and storytelling in every mathematical problem.
  In computer science, I see the impact of a good solution to a practical problem; 
  though the impact of a good story is undoubtedly important, I, as a low-income student, place greater priority on solving practical problems.
  However, I still love the humanities, and balance my courseload accordingly! I hope to be a bridge between the humanities and STEM, both in college and beyond.
