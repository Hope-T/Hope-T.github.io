## About
 Though I had planned on studying English, I realized that I love the simple groundedness and beauty of computer science and mathematics.
 At the same time, I realized that the books I most enjoyed reading were not the ones pored over in higher education. 
 Now, I see the beauty and storytelling in every mathematical problem.
 In computer science, I see the impact of a good solution to a practical problem.
 However, I still love the humanities, and balance my courseload accordingly! I hope to be a bridge between the humanities and STEM, both in college and beyond.
